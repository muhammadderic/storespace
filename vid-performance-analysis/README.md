# YouTube Channel Video Performance Analysis

This is a web application built using **Streamlit** to analyze the performance of videos from the YouTube channel **Ken Jee**, using data sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kenjee/ken-jee-youtube-data). The app allows users to explore video metrics such as views, likes, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Features

- **Video Performance Metrics**: Analyze the performance of each video in terms of views, likes, and comments.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore data through interactive plots, graphs, and tables.
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Understand how video performance evolves over time.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the performance of videos against one another based on various metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly**: For generating interactive visualizations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
